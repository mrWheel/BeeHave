# BeeHave
A device to log the temperature inside a beehive at specific intervals.

The objective is to create a device that will measure the temperature inside the beehive at certain intervals, 
for instance every one, two, three, four or six hours.

Design goals
The logging unit (from now on the “BeeHave Logger”) has to operate in a -more or less- harsh environment (the 
bee’s will stuff every hole with wax). The unit has to operate without intervention for at least one month on 
batteries, but preferable for two or three months. The BeeHave Logger has to be waterproof. The temperature 
sensor must be placed inside the honeycomb.
